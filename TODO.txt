Add construction preview resource ( renders/show ui stuff that helps with placement: neighbor/self pollution, resources in radius...)








BUILDINGS
-----------

Town Center
Farm Field
Factory ( Production Bonus from Resources/Distance, Pollution Penalty from nearby House/Park/Pond, Production Bonus from connected Houses immediate Neighbors/Road System )



FEATURES
----------

Pond
Deer, Production ( gets removed when buildings/road placed next to )
Forest Production (bonus with road), -Pollution(remove with road)
Work camp, required for deer/forest/etc to provide production?


UNITS
--------


( Autogenerated - chance from setting policies )

Boat
Engineer
Explorer
General


ROGUELITE ELEMENTS
---------------------

- Political Factions:
	Have multiple random agendas ( of certain spectrums ) and passive rewards ranks per satisfaction level
		for example: build 5x House, don't remove any deer, Harbor in 200 turns

	Extremists flag - may turn into rebels ( Rebel camp ), one fulfilled demand will remove extremist



CORE MECHANICS
----------------

- Production: 
	every tile has a production value, buildings can boost it
	slider turns it into money, construction points and luxury ( lost )

Power:
	Island-wide factory production multiplier ( 0 power = 0 production ) / number of factories

- Money

- Stability
	total party satisfaction
	low stability can cause random events that destroy, disable buildings, cost money etc

- Research
	from population, tech, university, features?
	
- Pollution
	from factory, power plant, features?
	reduces population by x%
	has thresholds with certain effects: >20= population * 0.95, >40= population * 0.9, >60= parks lose effect, >80= ponds lose production, >100= population * 0.75


OTHER MECHANICS
-----------------

- Road System
	factories/harbor/active power plants production increase for each other [factory/power provider/house/town center] connected

- Colonies ( not main/starting island )
	heavy construction cost penalty ( 500% ? ), can be reduced by research
	empire capital can be moved at heavy cost: temp. stability penalty, costs policy points and freezes point production for multiple years 


EVENTS
---------------

- Gain x research points when switching to Research y ( other research gets lost )



META
---------------

Daily Challenges
Achievements
at least 5 difficulty levels
campaign? 
	- each level gets harder ( only via difficulty level?? or also other random restrictions: locked research, building type etc )
	- each completed level ( reach custom goal ) awards meta points, even more for completed sub-goals?
	- meta points can be spent in ( only ) the following level at any point for money, research, temp stability boost etc

random campaigns?
