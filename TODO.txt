reform points generation decreases with amount of accumulated, unspent points

building list scroll

workstead not next to same, factory. factory not next to workstead

feature.on_neighbor_building_constructed() => deer will disappear

specialization policy => specialists points

discover() should trigger terrain generator

disable closing of event popups => make plain PanelContainer

force pause? while popups are open

use icons in top bar

implement power

implement stability

untoggle Research Button when popup is closed ( due to click outside )

show move cost in TileInfo

fog of war + building los ( town center high, other buildings low, outpost max)

tooltips


rename building levels => tiers
	TechnologyLevel=> Tier


oasis

add cliffs to terrain generator, terrain: moves property -1 ( impassable )

unit selected TileMapLayer effect blinking

implement ActiveEmpireModifierEffectFromPolicy ( apply with ratio )


Destroy buildings costs CP

? Remove empire effect modifiers from buildings? ( if they stay make them Array Collection like techs? )
	=> at least make stability a default Array?
	=> contra: how to make multiple bank levels provide interests?

Add construction preview resource ( renders/show ui stuff that helps with placement: neighbor/self pollution, resources in radius...)





use bigger images for Tier III buildings ( Highrise, Cathedral etc ). possible to add custom tile sizes to the buildings sheet?







BUILDINGS
-----------

Farm Field
Factory ( Production Bonus from Resources/Distance, extra Pollution Penalty from nearby House/Park/Pond, Production Bonus from connected Houses immediate Neighbors/Road System )
University ( Research+, stability penalty )
Bank ( Gain interest on money, yearly? )




FEATURES
----------

Deer, Production ( gets removed when buildings/road placed next to )
Forest Production (bonus with road), -Pollution(remove with road)
Work camp, required for deer/forest/etc to provide production?


UNITS
--------

( Autogenerated - chance from setting policies )
Limited number of actions

Engineer
	prospect for raw materials
	20 % chance to find something on existing, hidden tile
	1% chance to find something even if nothing exists??
	can search 20 times
	
Explorer ( = Settler )
	1 turn ( moving ) = 1 action, moves per turn increase with tech
	settling ( build Town center ) destroys it
	initial Explorer with unlimited AP?

General
	2 attacks, infinite defenses?



ROGUELITE ELEMENTS
---------------------

- Political Factions:
	Have multiple random agendas ( of certain spectrums ) and passive rewards ranks per satisfaction level
		for example: build 5x House, don't remove any deer, Harbor in 200 turns

	Extremists flag - may turn into rebels ( Rebel camp ), one fulfilled demand will remove extremist



CORE MECHANICS
----------------

- Production: 
	every tile has a production value, buildings can boost it
	slider turns it into money, construction points and luxury ( lost )

- Power:
	Island-wide factory production multiplier ( 0 power = 0 production ) / number of factories

- Money

- Stability
	total party satisfaction
	low stability can cause random events that destroy, disable buildings, cost money/progress points, spawn rebel camps

- Research
	from tech, university
	
- Pollution
	from factory, power plant, features?
	reduces population by x%
	has thresholds with certain effects: >20= population * 0.95, >40= population * 0.9, >60= parks lose effect, >80= ponds lose production, >100= population * 0.75


- Policies ( use progress points to change )
	[ Some will increase research speed when Tech is same category ]
	Welfare: Money yield turns into stability
	Expansion: Explorer visibility range, Explorer unit chance
	Spirituality: Religious buildings stability benefits, -reform points
	Militarism: General chance, -reform points
	Industrialization: Factory Productivity bonus, Engineer chance, +x pollution per workstead / factory [ worker_ratio bonus can exceed 1.0 if additional worker available ]
	Creativity: Chance to get regular Research events
	Progressiveness: generates more progress points, less stability
	Overtime
	
OTHER MECHANICS
-----------------

- Road System
	factories/harbor/active power plants production increase for each other [factory/power provider/house/town center] connected

- Colonies ( not main/starting island )
	heavy construction cost penalty ( 500% ? ), can be reduced by research
	empire capital can be moved at heavy cost: temp. stability penalty, costs policy points and freezes point production for multiple years 

- Building Removal Effects?
	- Church Stability - 20, House 1/2/3 Stab - 5/10/15, University + 10 

- Island floodfill, every towncenter built here will added to the island


EVENTS
---------------

- Gain x research points when switching to Research y ( other research gets lost )
- Stability penalty -x% when continuing current research
- Fire/etc damaged building: pay x so it doesnt get removed
- minus x Reform Points for stability boost / money


META
---------------

Daily Challenges
Achievements
at least 5 difficulty levels
campaign? 
	- each level gets harder ( only via difficulty level?? or also other random restrictions: locked research, building type etc )
	- each completed level ( reach custom goal ) awards meta points, even more for completed sub-goals?
	- meta points can be spent in ( only ) the following level at any point for money, research, temp stability boost etc

random campaigns?
